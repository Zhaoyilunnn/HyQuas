# HyQuas

HyQuas is a **Hy**brid partitioner based **Qua**ntum circuit **S**imulation system on GPU, which supports both single-GPU, single-node-multi-GPU, and multi-node-multi-GPU quantum circuit simulation.

For single-GPU simulation, it provides two highly optimized methods, _OShareMem_ and _TransMM_. _OShareMem_ method optimizes the shared-memory based quantum circuit simulation by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2.67 \times">. _TransMM_ method converts quantum circuit simulation to standard operations and enables the usage of highly optimized libraries like cuBLAS and powerful hardwares like Tensor Cores. It leads up to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=8.43 \times"> speedup over previous gate-merging based simulation. Moreover, it can select the better simulation method for different parts of a given quantum circuit according to its pattern.

For distributed simulation, it provides a GPU-centric communication pipelining approach. It can utilize the high-throughput NVLink connections to make the simulation even faster while still preserving low communication traffic.

Experimental results show that HyQuas can achieve up to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=10.71 \times"> speedup on a single GPU and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=227 \times"> speedup on a GPU cluster over state-of-the-art quantum circuit simulation systems.

## Compile and Run

1. Get the source code

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zhaoyilunnn/HyQuas.git --recursive
   ```

2. Specify the compute capability in `CMakeLists.txt` (`CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS`) and `third-party/cutt/Makefile` (`GENCODE_FLAGS`)

3. Prepare the following dependencies

   - cmake (tested on 3.12.3)
   - cuda (tested on 10.2.89 and 11.0.2)
   - g++ (compatible with cuda)
   - cublas (with the same version of cuda)
   - openmpi (tested on 4.0.5)
   - nccl (Fully tested on 2.9.6-1. Known that 2.7.8-1 cannot work. It will be blocked in an NCCL simulated MPI_Sendrecv.)
     And update environment variables like `CUDA_HOME`, `NCCL_ROOT`, `$PATH`, `$LIBRARY_PATH`, `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH` in `scripts/env.sh`.

> If the NCCL library is installed in a customized location, `export USR_INCLUDE=<path-to-your-directory>`

4. Compile the tensor transpose library `cutt`

   ```bash
   cd third-party/cutt
   make -j
   ```

5. Specify the root directory

   ```bash
   export HYQUAS_ROOT=${The_directory_running_git_clone}/HyQuas
   ```

6. Prepare the database for the time predictor

   ```bash
   mkdir -p evaluator-preprocess/parameter-files
   cd benchmark
   ./preprocess.sh
   ```

7. Example usages of HyQuas:
   HyQuas will use all GPUs it can detect, so please control the number of GPU by `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

   - Run a single circuit with single GPU

     ```bash
     cd scripts
     ./run-single.sh
     ```

   - Run a single circuit with multiple GPUs in one node

     ```bash
     cd scripts
     ./run-multi-GPU.sh
     ```

   - Run a single circuit with multiple GPUs in multiple nodes
     Please modify the `-host` first.

     ```bash
     cd scripts
     ./run-multi-node.sh
     ```

   - Run all circuits and check the correctness (The script trys both w/o MPI)
     ```bash
     cd scripts
     CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 ./check.sh
     ```

**Please use the commands in check.sh for evaluating the performance of HyQuas because the run\_\*.sh compiles the simulator in debug mode and check.sh compiles it in release mode.**

For more ways to use our simulator (like only using the _OShareMem_ method or _TransMM_ method, tuning off the overlap of communication and computation), and for reproducing our results in the ICS'21 paper, please refer to our `benchmark/` directory.

It also supports the following **unstable** feathers now. See our dev branch for details.

- Simulating more qubits by saving the state in CPU memory while still compute with GPU.
- An imperative mode, so that you do not need to explicitly call `c->compile();` and `c->run()`.
- Support for more control qubits.
- Support for some two-qubit gates.
- Fast measurement of quantum state.
